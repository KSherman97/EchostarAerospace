# EchoStar Aerospace

This repo contains code used for development of flight software, among other things, at EchoStar Aerospace.

EchoStar Aerospace is just what I am calling my amateur rocketry hobby. It should in no way be seen as an actual Aerospace company as I have no idea what I am doing. This is simply a hobby of mine that I am learning as I go.

My fleet consists of two rockets currently that are ~42 mm in diameter and ~ 0.6 meters tall.
I currently use a variety of Estes engines ranging from B class to E class.

I am learning about embedded electronic systems as I go, so this repo will consist largely of my attempts at making some stuff.
